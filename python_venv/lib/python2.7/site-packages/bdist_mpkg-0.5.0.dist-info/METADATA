==========
bdist_mpkg
==========

bdist_mpkg is a distutils plugin that implements the ``bdist_mpkg`` command.
The command builds a Mac OS X metapackage for use by Installer.app for easy GUI
installation of Python modules, much like ``bdist_wininst``.

It also comes with a ``bdist_mpkg`` script, which is a setup.py front-end that
will allow you to easy build an installer metapackage from nearly any existing
package that uses distutils.
